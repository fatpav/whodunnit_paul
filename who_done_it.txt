1.)Miss Scarlet dunnit
2.)Professor Plum dunnit because his variable is a Const and can't be changed
3.)Professor Plum dunnit again because though Mrs Peacock is named, her variable is inside the declareMurderer function and can't be reached outside it
4.)The suspects are Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum and Colonel Mustard.  Mrs Peacock is also as suspect because her variable is called in a second function
5.)The weapon is the revolver.  Because although scenario is a const and all the values inside are fixed, the weapon functions subsequently are those called and NOT the original function! HA!
6.)Mrs White done the deed.  It's DEFINITELY something to do with where plotTwist sits in the brackets but my keen detective's mind is having some trouble.
7.)
8.)
9.)I have no REAL idea the whats or hows of the last 3.  I ran them but wow...
